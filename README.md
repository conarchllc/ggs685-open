Tools to analyze twitter and gdelt data
Python code provides a set of analytic techniques to study ISIS use of social media. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to analyze tweets, find top terms, discover most popular retweets, search for the most similar posts to a given post, and correlate GDELT events.

Tools can be used to extract insights and track ISIS activities on social media, particularly the Twitter platform

The two key objectives were to (1) provide a flexible and extensible library of data collection tools that provides the user the ability to determine what data is collected and then execute a targeted collection by keywords, geographic regions, users, etc., (2) provide a library of analysis tools to enable analyst to filter, aggregate, and extract specific information from the collected datasets.

Collection methods

tweets by keywords
tweets by geographic location
friends and followers per user
account history per user
gdelt news for the same time periods as the twitter collections
Other methods:

Identification of top languages and countries based on keywords
Top terms and keyword frequencies and top re-posts
Clustering and ranking of most similar posts
Entity extraction by keywords (users, mentions, URLs)
Identification of top users and bots
Correlation of posts and news
Visualizing tweets spatially and temporally
Visualizing networks of users (friends and followers)
Visualizing networks of actors and events (gdelt)
